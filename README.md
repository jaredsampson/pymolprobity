# PyMOLProbity

#### A MOLProbity visualization plugin for PyMOL

The PyMOLProbity plugin allows a [PyMOL][] user to produce MolProbity-style
visualization of atomic interactions within a structure (e.g.  H-bonds, van der
Waals interactions and clashes) directly within a PyMOL session.  The plugin
runs local copies of several executable programs from the [Richardson Lab][] at
Duke University, authors of the [MolProbity][] software, parses the output, and
displays the results in the PyMOL viewport.  There are both a graphical user
interface (GUI) for general point-and-click use, and a command-line interface
(CLI) suitable for scripting.

## Getting Started

### Linux/MacOS only

Because the Reduce, Probe, and Prekin executables are only available for Linux
and MacOS, unfortunately PyMOLProbity is not currently useful on Windows.
However, if there is sufficient demand, it wouldn't be too difficult to add
support to read PDB and Kinemage files generated by the MolProbity server and
downloaded to the local filesystem.  Please submit a [feature request][] if
this interests you.

### Prerequisites

#### PyMOL

To use this PyMOL plugin, of course you will need to have PyMOL installed on
your machine.  Incentive PyMOL users can download precompiled binaries; for
those who don't have an Incentive PyMOL license, there is Open Source PyMOL.
Detailed instructions are available via the [PyMOL Wiki][], but briefly, the
easiest way to get Open Source PyMOL installed is probably to use a Package
Manager.

  [PyMOL Wiki]: http://www.pymolwiki.org/index.php/Category:Installation

On Debian/Ubuntu, for example:

```
apt-get install pymol
```

On a Mac, [Homebrew][] is a good option.  Install [XQuartz][] if you don't have
it already (this can be done without Homebrew, but Homebrew Cask simply
automates the downloading and running of the installer:

  [Homebrew]: http://www.brew.sh/
  [XQuartz]: https://www.xquartz.org/

```
brew install Caskroom/cask/xquartz
```

and then PyMOL:

```
brew install homebrew/science/pymol
```

Homebrew's PyMOL formula requires Python to be installed `--with-tcl-tk` and
Tcl/Tk to be installed `--with-threads --with-x11`, so if you've already
installed either of those with Homebrew, you'll have to unlink and reinstall
them.

#### MolProbity programs

To work properly, PyMOLProbity requires 4 programs from the MolProbity software
package: Reduce, Probe, Flipkin (actually a Perl script), and Prekin, which are
available from the Richardson Lab [Github account][].  There are two general
ways to satisfy these requirements.

  [Github account]: https://github.com/rlabduke

1. **With PHENIX.** If you have [PHENIX][]
installed and properly configured, you already have Reduce and Probe
available as `phenix.reduce` and `phenix.probe`, so you only need Flipkin and
Prekin.

  * **Direct download links (right click, Save as...):**
  * Flipkin: [PHENIX-compatible version][fkp]
  * Prekin: [Linux (64-bit)][pkl64], [Linux (32-bit)][pkl32], [MacOS][pkm]

  You will need to create either aliases or symlinks to the `phenix.xxx`
  executables so PyMOLProbity can find them by calling `reduce` and `probe` from
  the shell.  For example, the following added to `~/.bashrc` should be
  sufficient in most cases.

  ```
  alias reduce=phenix.reduce
  alias probe=phenix.probe
  ```


  [PHENIX]: http://www.phenix-online.org/

2. **Without PHENIX.**  If you do not wish to install PHENIX, you'll need to
download all 4 programs.  Note that the appropriate Flipkin in this case is an
older version of the script, as the latest version specifies
`phenix.reduce` and `phenix.probe` explicitly.

  * **Direct download links (right click, Save as...):**
  * Reduce: [Linux][rl], [MacOS][rm]
  * Probe: [Linux][pl], [MacOS][pmac]
  * Flipkin: [Non-PHENIX version][fkold]
  * Prekin: [Linux (64-bit)][pkl64], [Linux (32-bit)][pkl32], [MacOS][pkm]

  [rl]: https://github.com/rlabduke/MolProbity/raw/master/bin/linux/reduce
  [rm]: https://github.com/rlabduke/MolProbity/raw/master/bin/macosx/reduce
  [pl]: https://github.com/rlabduke/MolProbity/raw/master/bin/linux/probe
  [pmac]: https://github.com/rlabduke/MolProbity/raw/master/bin/macosx/probe
  [fkp]: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rlabduke/MolProbity/master/bin/flipkin
  [fkold]: https://github.com/rlabduke/MolProbity/raw/4f09d8a7e888d865fecec99a9b7338303b0cbc51/bin/flipkin
  [pkl64]: https://github.com/rlabduke/MolProbity/raw/master/bin/linux/prekin_64
  [pkl32]: https://github.com/rlabduke/MolProbity/raw/master/bin/linux/prekin_32
  [pkm]: https://github.com/rlabduke/MolProbity/raw/master/bin/macosx/prekin

Place the downloaded files in a directory on the shell `PATH` such as
`/usr/local/bin` and make sure they are executable:

```
cd /usr/local/bin
chmod +x flipkin prekin probe reduce
```

You may also wish to download the Richardson group's "slightly modified version
of the connectivity table published by the PDB" from the [Reduce software page][rp].  This file should be placed in `/usr/local`.  If you don't, you'll
probably get the following error when you run Reduce:

  [rp]: http://kinemage.biochem.duke.edu/software/reduce.php

```
ERROR CTab(/usr/local/reduce_wwPDB_het_dict.txt): could not open
```


### Installation

Installation of PyMOLProbity itself should be straightforward using PyMOL's
[Plugin Manager][pm].  (Mac users note: Plugins are only available for MacPyMOL
if you use the X11 hybrid [tweak][], which entails simply renaming or copying
`MacPyMOL.app` to `PyMOLX11Hybrid.app` in your Applications folder.)

  [pm]: http://www.pymolwiki.org/index.php/Plugin_Manager
  [tweak]: http://www.pymolwiki.org/index.php/Plugins#Plugins_on_OS_X

Launch PyMOL, open the Plugin Manager from the menu (*Plugin* > *Plugin
Manager*), and navigate to the *Install New Plugin* tab.  Paste the following
URL into the *URL* box and click *Fetch*.

    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jaredsampson/pymolprobity/master/pymolprobity.tar.gz

Confirm you wish to proceed with the download and the plugin will be installed
automatically.  Alternatively, you can [download][] the zipped plugin archive
file and select it using the file chooser.

  [download]: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jaredsampson/pymolprobity/master/pymolprobity.tar.gz

### First run

Now you can open PyMOL, load or fetch a structure, and launch PyMOLProbity from
the Plugin menu.  Use the *Add Hydrogens* tab to add hydrogens with Reduce.
This will also calculate which N/Q/H residue side chains should be flipped.  If
you would like to examine these more closely, use the *Review Flips* tab to
examine each flippable residue and choose the ones you wish to flip or keep.
Save these using the *Save Selections* button.  Finally, use the *Visualize
Contacts* tab to run Probe on the modified coordinates and generate contact
dots and clash vectors for all the atoms in your object.

## Development

Users who wish to inspect or tinker with the code or contribute to development
may wish to clone the repository.

```
git clone https://github.com/jaredsampson/pymolprobity.git
cd pymolprobity
```

### Running the unit tests

A unit testing suite is included in the `tests` subdirectory.

Running the tests requires the Python packages `nose`, `mock`, and optionally
`coverage`.  If you have these installed already, you can skip this step; if
not, run the following command to install the three packages and their
dependencies using [`conda`]() if available, and [`pip`]() otherwise.

```
make init
```

In the case of `conda`, the packages will be created in a new environment
called `mp`, which you should then activate with:

```
source activate mp
```

`virtualenv` users can run `make init` from within an activated virtualenv to
keep these packages out of your global Python environment as well.

Once `nose` and `mock` are installed, run the unit tests with

```
make test
```

To run the tests and determine code coverage:

```
make testcov
```

To see a full coverage report, including line numbers missed by the tests:

```
make cov
```

### Troubleshooting

If you run the tests and get errors like:

```
ImportError: No module named pymol
ImportError: No module named chempy
```

it means your PyMOL installation's Python modules are not being found by
Python.  The easiest way to solve this (which is accounted for in the Makefile)
is to set `PYMOL_HOME` in your `~/.bashrc` file and start a new terminal
session.

```
export PYMOL_HOME=/path/to/pymol-installation/libexec/lib/python2.7/site-packages
```

where `/path/to/pymol-installation/bin/pymol` is the absolute path to your
PyMOL executable.

this software.  Specifically, I am grateful to the PyMOL developers, Thomas
Holder, Blaine Bell, and Gabriel Marques, for their help, guidance, and
patience.

programs on which this plugin depends, and to Bradley Hintze and Christopher
Williams in particular for their help in answering questions I had about the
programs.
